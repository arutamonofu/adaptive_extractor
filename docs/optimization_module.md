# Optimization Module Architecture & Workings

## 1. Overview & Core Features

The **Optimization** module automates extraction agent prompt and instruction tuning using DSPy's MIPROv2 Bayesian optimization. It also handles ground truth validation, dataset compilation, and MLflow experiment tracking.

In addition to Bayesian optimization, it features a **Ground Truth (GT) Contrastive Analyzer** subsystem. This subsystem compares the extraction model's predictions with ground truth data on a sample of training documents using a Map-Reduce pipeline, identifies inconsistencies and rules, resolves discrepancies interactively with a human reviewer, and compiles them into a structured three-level prompt instruction.

### Key Capabilities:
*   **Prompt Self-Optimization**: Proposing, testing, and selecting high-performing prompt instructions and few-shot examples using MIPROv2.
*   **GT Contrastive Analysis**: Automatically extracting rules and finding conflicts by comparing model outputs against GT using an LLM-in-the-loop Map-Reduce process.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop CLI**: Interactive command-line workflow for reviewing, editing, and merging extraction rule discrepancies.
*   **Three-Level Prompt Compiler**: Programmatic compilation of prompt instructions partitioned into System (`[META]`), Row/Entity (`[ENTITY]`), and Field/Schema (`[SCHEMA]`) constraints.
*   **Validation Checks**: Pre-flight data validation ensuring splits consistency and ground-truth alignments.
*   **Experiment Tracking**: Automatic logging of runs, metrics, and models to MLflow.

### Detailed Phases & In-Process Pipeline:

1. **Validation & Setup Phase**:
   * [DataValidator](../src/ae/optimization/dataset.py#L51) reads data splits and ground truth. It validates that splits files contain valid names (`train`, `val`), checks for duplicates and splits overlap, verifies that all split keys are registered in the ground truth CSV, and normalizes document names.
   * [DatasetBuilder](../src/ae/optimization/dataset.py#L326) processes valid document Markdown keys, loads corresponding parsed texts, and loads ground truth records to output compiled sets of `dspy.Example`.

2. **GT Contrastive Analysis Phase (Map-Reduce)**:
   * **Map Phase (`LocalAnalyzer`)**: For each document in the specified batch, the analyzer queries the Teacher LM to compare the document text with the Ground Truth data. On every attempt (including retries), a **fresh anonymous subclass** of `AnalyzeDocumentSignature` is created via `type()`, ensuring complete prompt isolation per coroutine — no shared mutable state between concurrent tasks. It generates specific observations regarding entity inclusions/exclusions and field formatting/extractions.
   * **Reduce Phase (`StrictAggregator`)**: Aggregates observations across all documents. Before each LLM call, rule formulations are serialized as a **Markdown bullet list** (`- rule text`) to improve model comprehension. The `SemanticEquivalenceChecker` backed by the Teacher LM evaluates which observation patterns represent a 100% consensus rule. The returned `is_unanimous` field is parsed via **`TypeAdapter(bool).validate_python()`** to safely coerce DSPy string outputs (`"True"`, `"False"`, etc.) to actual Python booleans, with a fail-safe fallback to `False` on parse errors.
   * **Interactive Review (`HumanReviewCLI`)**: If discrepancies are found and `auto-skip-review` is false, an interactive prompt runs in the CLI, showing the conflicting patterns, text evidence, and affected documents. The user can select `accept_a`, `accept_b`, provide a `custom_rule`, or `skip`.
   * **Compilation (`build_three_level_prompt`)**: Compiles all verified and user-resolved rules into a structured instruction with three distinct levels:
     * `[META]`: System-wide settings (e.g., direct extraction, no calculations).
     * `[ENTITY]`: Row-level criteria defining which entities should be extracted or ignored.
     * `[SCHEMA]`: Specific instructions defining validation and formatting rules per field.

3. **Dynamic Signature Injection & Tuning Loop (MIPROv2)**:
   * If contrastive analysis is enabled, `OptimizeAgentUseCase` generates a dynamic signature class mapping the 3-level prompt to the `__doc__` of the class. It overrides the default signature class, utilizing minimal schema annotations (suppressing verbose field descriptions to prevent prompt dilution).
   * Generates `num_candidates` proposed instructions and sets up Optuna Bayesian search.
   * Evaluates prompt layouts on the validation split. Evaluators calculate extraction metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) by validating predicted objects against ground truth lists.

4. **Persistence & Logging Phase**:
   * The best optimized instruction set and demonstration weights are saved to a task-specific agent JSON file.
   * Metrics, run configs, and models are registered in MLflow. If contrastive analysis is active, metrics such as the number of verified rules and discrepancies are automatically logged to the MLflow run.

}
```

## 7. Error Handling & Resiliency

*   **Pre-flight Failure Interception**: The `DataValidator` raises immediate exceptions on duplicate split entries, empty sets, or missing ground-truth coverage, preventing wasted API costs.
*   **Contrastive Phase Fallback**: If the contrastive analysis Map-Reduce or aggregation steps fail (e.g., due to API rate limits or model timeouts), the optimizer logs a warning and gracefully falls back to the default signature/instruction config, ensuring optimization runs can complete uninterrupted.
*   **LLM Connection Resiliency**: LLM client providers implement exponential backoff with random jitter to gracefully recover from network or API rate limits (`429 Too Many Requests`).
*   **MD5-based Signature Isolation**: Because DSPy uses internal module caching, dynamic signature classes are generated with unique names embedding the MD5 hash of their compiled prompt (e.g., `DynamicExtractionSignature_<hash>`). This prevents signature class pollution and ensures DSPy's SQLite tracking registry evaluates prompts correctly across different runs.
*   **Per-attempt Prompt Isolation (Race Condition Guard)**: Each call to `LocalAnalyzer.analyze()` — including every retry — creates a **new anonymous subclass** of `AnalyzeDocumentSignature` using `type("DynamicAnalyzeSignature", (AnalyzeDocumentSignature,), {"__doc__": instruction})`. This prevents concurrent coroutines (when `max_concurrent > 1`) from overwriting each other's prompts via the shared global class.
*   **Safe Boolean Coercion (Zero-Tolerance Consensus Guard)**: DSPy's `dspy.Predict` may return boolean output fields as strings (`"True"`, `"False"`). Because any non-empty string is truthy in Python, the raw `result.is_unanimous` field is **never used directly in a conditional**. Instead, `TypeAdapter(bool).validate_python(result.is_unanimous)` from Pydantic handles all edge cases (`"true"`, `"false"`, `"yes"`, `"no"`, `1`, `0`). If parsing fails, the system conservatively defaults to `False`, routing the observation to manual review.
*   **Self-contained JSON Parser**: `LocalAnalyzer` no longer imports `extract_json` from `aggregator.py`. When a prediction returns a raw string, a local `re.search(r'```(?:json)?\s*(.*?)\s*```', ...)` regex strips Markdown fences before `json.loads()`, eliminating the cross-module dependency and any risk of circular imports.
*   **Order-Preserving Batch Execution**: `ContrastiveMapRunner.run_batch()` delegates to `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` and returns its result directly. This guarantees the output list index always matches the input list index, regardless of which coroutine finishes first — eliminating the ordering bug caused by non-deterministic `list.append()` side effects in the previous implementation.
